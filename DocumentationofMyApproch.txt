Overview:
    This Testcafe is design to automate a testcases, which makes it reliable and efficent.
  The primary focus is to check functinality of Login page(URL provided) with with valid 
  as well as invalid crediantials.

Test Scenarios: 
    1.Login with valid credintials and validate the actual result with expected using
    assertion provided by Testcafe(including Crossbrowser)
      steps: Go to URL> enter username >enter password>click on login button>validate 
    2. Login with invalid credintials and print out the message in console using console.log.
      steps: Go to URL> enter invalidusername >enter invalid password>click on login button>print
       error message(including Crossbrowser)

Challenges:
   1. Settijup Testcafe: I alredy have Nodejs and VS code but settingup testcafe was little bit
     hard for me after some errors i was able to install Testcafe.
   2. At first I faced some dificulty in selcting textbox,button selctor and how to implement it in code
   3. Assertions: face some minor dificulty in asserting results as well.
      This was some challenges/dificulties I face during this assignement but after some time
       I was handy with Testcafe sructure.
